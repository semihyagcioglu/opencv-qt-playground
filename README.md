Experiments with OpenCV using Qt

- A few sample application I have implemented in C++ using OpenCV library and Qt framework
- Each app is created as standalone project under seperate directories
- These are just simple apps just to experiment with OpenCV 3.0
- You might need to change the paths for files to read
- You probably might need to change the LIBS in Qt project files according to your set up
- Tested on MacOSX 10.10, Qt 5 and OpenCV 3
